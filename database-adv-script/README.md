# Task 0 - Write Complex Joins

This task contains SQL queries for:
- INNER JOIN to get all bookings with their users
- LEFT JOIN to get all properties and their reviews (including those with no reviews)

## Task 1 - Practice Subqueries

This task contains two SQL subqueries:

- A query to retrieve properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 (non-correlated subquery)

All queries are stored in the file: `subqueries.sql`
